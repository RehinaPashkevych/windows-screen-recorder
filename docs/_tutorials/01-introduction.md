## Introduction to Rust

Rust is a modern programming language that focuses on safety, speed, and concurrency. It achieves these goals by avoiding the pitfalls of null pointers and dangling pointers, as well as ensuring thread safety. Rust's rich type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety and thread-safety â€” enabling you to eliminate many classes of bugs at compile-time.

## Prerequisites

Before you dive into Rust, you should have a basic understanding of general programming concepts. It's helpful if you are familiar with the concepts of programming languages like C++, though it's not strictly necessary. To get started with Rust, you will need:

- **A computer with a command-line interface (CLI)**: Rust is supported on Linux, Windows, and macOS.
- **Installation of Rust**: You can install Rust using `rustup`, which is Rust's official installation utility. Visit the [official Rust installation page](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and follow the instructions for your operating system.

## Basic Commands

Once you have Rust installed, you can use the following commands to manage your Rust projects:

- **`cargo run`**: This command compiles your project and runs the resulting executable. For instance, if you have a project for a simple "Hello, world!" program, running `cargo run` will compile and execute it in one step.

- **`cargo build`**: This command compiles your project but does not run it. It is useful for checking if your project compiles successfully without necessarily running it.

Both commands are fundamental to daily Rust development and testing.

## Further Resources

To deepen your knowledge of Rust, consider the following resources:

- [The Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/): Often referred to as "The Book," it is the most comprehensive resource for learning Rust from scratch.
- [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/): A collection of runnable examples that illustrate various Rust concepts and standard libraries.
- [Rust by Practice](https://practice.course.rs): My favourite site. I saw the [Complete Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpPEoZW5IiY) doing it.
- [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/): Small exercises to get you used to reading and writing Rust code.

By exploring these resources and practicing regularly, you can quickly become proficient in Rust and start building your own safe and fast applications.
